## About Me

I'm a Ph.D. student from [City University of Hong Kong](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Rynson W.H. Lau](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~rynson/). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree from [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/) in 2023. My research interests span the area of computer vision and deep learning, especially the 3D scene understanding and multi-modal representation.
